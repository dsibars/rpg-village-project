# Calendar & Defense Events (C5)

## Overview
The Calendar & Defense system adds a seasonal cycle and periodic raid events that threaten the village. Players must assign idle heroes to defense positions to protect against incoming raids. Raids are auto-resolved based on defense power vs raid power.

## Season System

### Seasons
- **Spring** (Days 1-30): +5% growth bonus
- **Summer** (Days 31-60): +10% farm production bonus
- **Autumn** (Days 61-90): +10% miner production bonus
- **Winter** (Days 91-120): -10% farm production penalty

### Cycle
- Each season lasts 30 days
- Year cycles every 120 days
- Season effects are applied passively during production calculations

## Raid Events

### Generation
- First raid occurs no earlier than Day 7
- **First raid is delayed until the player has at least 4 heroes** (new player protection)
  - *Configurable:* `MIN_HEROES_FOR_FIRST_RAID` constant in `CalendarService.js`. Set to `2` for testing, `4` for production.
- Subsequent raids occur every 7-14 days (pseudo-random, deterministic per day seed)
- Events are generated 14 days in advance
- Old resolved events are cleaned up automatically

### Raid Scaling
- **Level**: `max(1, floor(day / 10) + floor(totalRegionClears / 5))`
- **Enemy Count**: `min(6, 2 + floor(day / 20))`
- **Enemy Pool**: Scales with day — basic enemies early, advanced at day 20+, bosses at day 40+

### Defense Assignment
- Up to 4 heroes can be assigned to defense at any time
- Only idle heroes with HP > 0 can be assigned
- **A hero on an expedition cannot be assigned to defense** (mutual exclusion)
- **Assigning a hero to an expedition auto-removes them from defense**
- Defense assignments persist until the raid is resolved
- After a raid, all defenders are automatically unassigned

### Defense Power Calculation
- Sum of each defender's `strength + defense + (maxHp / 10)`
- +10 power per Housing level
- +5 power per assigned Scout worker

### Raid Resolution (Auto)
- Win chance: `clamp(0.15, 0.5 + (defensePower - raidPower) / raidPower * 0.3, 0.95)`
- **Victory**: Gold reward = `raidLevel * 10 + random(0-20)`
- **Defeat (with 1+ defenders)**: 
  - Lose 3-8 wood and 3-8 stone
  - 15% chance to damage a random building (level -1)
- **Defeat (with 0 defenders)**:
  - Lose **100% of gold**
  - Lose **100% of materials** (wood, stone, iron, etc.)
  - Lose **100% of food**
  - **50% chance** to damage a random building (level -1)
- **Defender Damage**: 15% max HP on victory, 40% max HP on defeat (minimum 1 HP)

## Defense Advisory System

Before assigning heroes to an expedition, the engine checks whether the village would be left undefended at the next raid.

### Advisory Logic
1. Compute expedition duration from `exp.stages.length` (accounting for scout/explorer guild reductions).
2. Compute `expeditionReturnDay = currentDay + duration`.
3. Find the next unresolved raid day from the calendar.
4. Simulate the assignment: count remaining idle heroes after removing the assigned heroes.
5. Check if any other active expedition will return before the next raid with heroes that could defend.

### Warning Trigger
A warning is shown when **all** of the following are true:
- The assignment would leave `0` idle heroes
- There is an upcoming unresolved raid
- The expedition will not return before that raid
- No other expedition returns before that raid with available heroes

### Player Choice
The warning is **advisory, not a block**. The player can:
- **Cancel** and keep their heroes idle
- **Proceed Anyway** and accept the risk

If they proceed and the raid fires with 0 defenders, the severe penalty applies.

## UI Components

### Calendar Widget
- Shows current season with icon (🌸☀️🍂❄️)
- Shows day of season (e.g., "Spring (15/30)")
- Lists up to 5 upcoming events with day offset labels ("Today", "Tomorrow", "D+3")
- Raid events highlighted in red when within 2 days

### Defense Widget
- Shows assigned defenders as removable chips
- Shows count "(N/4)"
- Lists available idle heroes as assignable buttons
- Max 4 defenders; buttons disabled when full

### Book Integration
- Raid results are recorded as `village_updates` Book sections on the day they resolve.
- Victory: adds a `book_update_raid_defended` bullet to the day's village updates.
- Defeat: adds a `book_update_raid_lost` bullet to the day's village updates.
- The Book button glows after the day advances; the player can open the Book from the top bar to read the outcome.

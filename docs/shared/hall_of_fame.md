# Hall of Fame

> **A living record of your heroes' journeys.** Not for retired legends — for the heroes fighting right now.

---

## Core Concept

Every hero accumulates **lifetime stats** across all battles and expeditions. The Hall of Fame displays these stats, awards **titles** based on achievements, and lets players compare heroes.

**Why it fits the rules:**
- ✅ **Easy to add:** Just aggregate existing data. No new mechanics.
- ✅ **Early-game relevant:** Arthur gets his first title at Level 5. Immediate dopamine.
- ✅ **Simple UI:** One page, hero cards, stats grids.

## Implementation

### Data Storage

Add a `lifetimeStats` object to each hero:

```javascript
this.lifetimeStats = data.lifetimeStats || {
    battlesWon: 0,
    battlesLost: 0,
    enemiesDefeated: 0,
    totalDamageDealt: 0,
    totalHealingDone: 0,
    highestSingleHit: 0,
    criticalHits: 0,
    timesKOd: 0,
    expeditionsCompleted: 0,
    expeditionsFailed: 0,
    stagesCleared: 0,
    goldEarned: 0,
    skillCasts: {},  // { multiple_attack: 450, power_strike: 120 }
    spellCasts: {},  // { meteor_strike: 89, ... }
    trainingDays: 0,
    defensesParticipated: 0
};
```

### Where Stats Update

| Event | Stat Updated |
|-------|-------------|
| Battle won | `battlesWon++`, `enemiesDefeated += count` |
| Battle lost | `battlesLost++` |
| Damage dealt | `totalDamageDealt += amount`, check `highestSingleHit` |
| Heal cast | `totalHealingDone += amount` |
| Crit landed | `criticalHits++` |
| Hero KO'd | `timesKOd++` |
| Skill used | `skillCasts[skillId]++` |
| Spell cast | `spellCasts[spellName]++` |
| Expedition complete | `expeditionsCompleted++`, `stagesCleared += count` |
| Expedition fail | `expeditionsFailed++` |
| Training finished | `trainingDays += days` |

### Title Assignment

Check after every battle/expedition:
```javascript
if (hero.lifetimeStats.enemiesDefeated >= 100 && !hero.hasTitle('the Slayer')) {
    hero.addTitle('the Slayer');
    // Notification: "Arthur has earned the title 'the Slayer'!"
}
```

## Why This Engages Early/Mid Game

| Stage | Hall of Fame Moment |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Day 1-5** | Arthur gets "the Recruit" at Level 5. First dopamine hit. |
| **Day 10** | Arthur gets "the Slayer" at 100 kills. You see his journey. |
| **Day 20** | Elara gets "the Spellweaver" at 10 spells. Mage identity. |
| **Day 30** | Comparing Arthur vs Elara damage. Friendly rivalry. |
| **Day 50** | First "the Master" title at Tier 10 skill. Achievement. |
| **Day 100** | Full Hall of Fame. 20 heroes. Different titles. A tapestry. |

> **The Hall of Fame makes every hero feel like a protagonist.** Not just stats — a story.

## Open Questions

1. **Should titles give mechanical bonuses?** Or purely cosmetic? (I suggest cosmetic to keep it simple.)
2. **Should there be a "Hero of the Week"?** Auto-highlight the hero with most progress this week?
3. **Export/share?** "Arthur the Slayer — 312 kills, 45k damage" shareable text?

# Magic Circle System Specification

## Overview

The **Magic Circle System** is a spellcrafting subsystem where players compose spells by arranging **Glyphs** — permanent magical drawings that heroes learn — on an expanding, concentric-circle interface. Inspired by the glyph-weaving magic of *Witch Hat Atelier* and the Lumina composition system from *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*.

A Glyph is **knowledge of a drawing**. Once learned, a hero knows it forever. The Magic Circle is not a fixed board — it is a **living mandala that expands** as the hero's magical power grows.

**Core Loop:**
1. Learn Glyphs (from tablets, mastery, or the Academy).
2. Arrange them on the hero's Magic Circle.
3. Preview damage, MP cost, and effects.
4. Name and inscribe the spell to the hero's Codex.
5. Cast it in combat — each cast trains the Glyphs, slowly unlocking higher tiers.

> **Status:** Active Design — Partially Implemented.

## The Visual: An Expanding Mandala

The Magic Circle is a set of **concentric rings** centered on a single **Core** slot. As a hero's **Magic Tier** increases, new slots light up one by one, expanding outward like ripples.

### Tier 1 — The Spark (Core only)
```
              ╭──────╮
             │ [CORE] │
              ╰──────╯
```
Only the **Core** slot is available.

### Tier 4 — The First Ring (Core + 3 complementary slots)
```
                    ╭──────────────╮
                   ╱  [C-0]  [C-1]  ╲
                  │ [C-5]  [CORE]  [C-2] │
                   ╲  [C-4]  [C-3]  ╱
                    ╰──────────────╯
```
The first **donut ring** appears around the Core. Each tier unlocks **one slot** on this ring.

### Tier 7 — The First Ring Complete (Core + 6 complementary slots)
```
                    ╭──────────────╮
                   ╱  [C-0]  [C-1]  ╲
                  │ [C-5]  [CORE]  [C-2] │
                   ╲  [C-4]  [C-3]  ╱
                    ╰──────────────╯
```
All 6 slots of Ring 1 are now open.

### Tier 8 — The Second Ring Opens
```
              ╭────────────────────────╮
             ╱    [R2-0]    [R2-1]     ╲
            │  [R2-5]              [R2-2]  │
            │       ╭──────────────╮        │
            │      ╱  [C-0]  [C-1]  ╲       │
            │     │ [C-5]  [CORE]  [C-2]     │
            │      ╲  [C-4]  [C-3]  ╱       │
            │       ╰──────────────╯        │
            │  [R2-4]              [R2-3]  │
             ╲    [R2-?]    [R2-?]     ╱
              ╰────────────────────────╯
```
Tier 8 adds a **second concentric ring** (Ring 2). Its first slot lights up. The pattern continues outward.

### Late Game — Tier 25+ (Level 376 Hero)
```
              ╭────────────────────────────────╮
             ╱        [R4]        [R4]          ╲
            │    [R4]                  [R4]       │
            │         ╭──────────────╮            │
            │        ╱    [R2]  [R2]   ╲          │
            │       │ [R2]  [CORE]  [R2] │         │
            │        ╲    [R2]  [R2]   ╱          │
            │         ╰──────────────╯            │
            │    [R4]                  [R4]       │
             ╲        [R4]        [R4]          ╱
              ╰────────────────────────────────╯
```
A legendary mage could have **4 full rings** = Core + 24 complementary slots = **25 total slots**. With ~1,000 MP (level 300+ with arcane origin and gear), a 25-slot spell could cost 800+ MP — castable once, then the mage is drained.

---

## Hero Magic Tiers

When the Magic Circle system is unlocked, **all heroes are Tier 1 mages by default**. As heroes cast spells, they gain hidden **Magic Insight** experience. Each Magic Tier increase unlocks **exactly one new slot** on their personal Magic Circle.

### Tier Progression

| Magic Tier | Slots Unlocked | Visual State |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** | 1 slot (Core only) | A single inner circle |
| **Tier 2** | 2 slots (Core + 1 complementary) | First slot of Ring 1 lights up |
| **Tier 3** | 3 slots (Core + 2 complementary) | Second slot of Ring 1 lights up |
| **...** | ... | ... |
| **Tier 7** | 7 slots (Core + 6 complementary) | Ring 1 is complete |
| **Tier 8** | 8 slots (Core + 6 + 1) | First slot of Ring 2 lights up |
| **...** | ... | ... |
| **Tier 13** | 13 slots (Core + 12) | Ring 2 is complete |
| **Tier 14** | 14 slots (Core + 12 + 1) | First slot of Ring 3 lights up |
| **...** | ... | ... |

### Ring Capacity

Each concentric ring (donut) holds a fixed number of slots. When a ring is full, the next tier adds a new outer ring.

| Ring | Slots | Tier Range to Fill |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Core (center) | 1 | Always available (Tier 1) |
| Ring 1 | 6 | Tiers 2–7 |
| Ring 2 | 6 | Tiers 8–13 |
| Ring 3 | 6 | Tiers 14–19 |
| Ring 4 | 6 | Tiers 20–25 |
| Ring N | 6 | Tiers (6N-4) to (6N+1) |

> **Why 6 slots per ring?** Hexagonal symmetry looks stunning visually, gives satisfying progression milestones every 6 tiers, and scales well into late game.

### Magic Insight (Hidden)

Magic Insight is the hidden XP gained when a hero casts spells. It is **completely invisible** to the player — no bars, no numbers, no percentages.

```
Insight Gained = Spell MP Cost × 0.5 × (1 + Average Glyph Tier in Spell)
```

| Tier Transition | Insight Required | Approx. Spells (avg 20 MP) |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 → 2 | 500 | ~50 |
| 2 → 3 | 800 | ~80 |
| 3 → 4 | 1,200 | ~120 |
| 4 → 5 | 1,800 | ~180 |
| 5 → 6 | 2,500 | ~250 |
| 6 → 7 | 3,500 | ~350 |
| 7 → 8 (new ring!) | 5,000 | ~500 |
| 8 → 9 | 6,500 | ~650 |
| 9 → 10 | 8,500 | ~850 |
| 10 → 11 | 11,000 | ~1,100 |
| 11 → 12 | 14,000 | ~1,400 |
| 12 → 13 | 18,000 | ~1,800 |
| 13 → 14 (new ring!) | 23,000 | ~2,300 |

> **The player never sees these numbers.** The only way to gauge progress is through the [Witch's Hut](#the-witchs-hut).

### Tier-Up Moment

When a hero crosses a tier threshold, a **mystical event** fires:
- The hero's portrait gains a subtle new aura (elemental color based on most-used Core Glyph).
- A notification appears: *"[Hero] feels the weave of magic shift within them..."*
- The Magic Circle screen, when next opened, animates — a new slot lights up with a particle burst.
- If a new ring is born, the entire circle subtly expands outward.

The hero themselves does not know what changed — only that *something* changed. The player must discover the new slot by opening the Circle.

---

## Glyphs

### Glyph Tiers (Infinite Mastery)

Every Glyph exists in **multiple quality grades**. Higher-tier Glyphs represent the same drawing with greater mastery.

**How tiers unlock:**
1. **Find a higher-tier Glyph Tablet** in expeditions (RNG).
2. **Master the Glyph through use** — casting spells containing a Tier 1 Glyph slowly unlocks Tier 2, then Tier 3, then Tier 4, and so on.

> Just like physical skills, glyph mastery is **hidden**. The player never sees a "47/100" counter. They just notice one day that their `+` became `++`.

**Tier effect and cost scaling:**

| Tier | Symbol | Effect Multiplier | MP Cost Modifier | Mastery Threshold (uses) |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | `+` | 1.0× base | +0% | 0 (learned immediately) |
| 2 | `++` | 1.2× base | +15% | ~500 uses |
| 3 | `+++` | 1.5× base | +30% | ~2,000 uses |
| 4 | `✦` | 2.0× base | +50% | ~10,000 uses |
| 5 | `✦✦` | 2.5× base | +75% | ~50,000 uses |
| 6 | `✦✦✦` | 3.0× base | +100% | ~200,000 uses |
| 7 | `✶` | 4.0× base | +150% | ~1,000,000 uses |

> **Example:** A Tier 7 Potentiate gives +400% damage but increases MP cost by +150%. Good luck casting a 15-component spell with multiple Tier 7 glyphs.

**Formula:** Tier N requires `500 × 4^(N-2)` uses to reach from Tier N-1. The jump from Tier 4 to 5 is roughly 5× harder than 3 to 4.

#### Static Glyphs (No Tier Growth)

Some Glyphs are **conceptually boolean** — their effect does not improve with higher tiers. These Glyphs still display a tier symbol (`+`), but they **never evolve past Tier 1** through mastery. Their cost and effect are fixed regardless of tier.

| Glyph | Why Static |
|---|---|
| `glyph_multi` | Hitting "all targets" is binary — there's no gradation |
| `glyph_aegis` | Targeting allies is binary — there's no gradation |

> **Design rationale:** A hero who draws the Multi glyph a thousand times doesn't "draw it better" — they already know how to make it hit everything. The mastery system only applies to Glyphs whose effect or cost actually scales with tier.

### Glyph Categories

**Core Glyphs** — Placed in the center slot. Determine element and base power.

| ID | Element | Base DMG | Base MP | Ally Factor |
|----|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `glyph_fire` | 🔥 Fire | High | Medium | 0.20 |
| `glyph_water` | 💧 Water | Low | Low | 0.25 |
| `glyph_wind` | 🌪️ Wind | Medium | Low | 0.22 |
| `glyph_storm` | ⚡ Storm | Medium | High | 0.18 |
| `glyph_light` | ✨ Light | Low | High | 0.30 |
| `glyph_dark` | 🌑 Dark | Very High | Very High | 0.15 |
| `glyph_earth` | 🪨 Earth | Medium | Medium | 0.25 |

**Power Glyphs** — Amplify damage or effects.

| ID | Name | Tier 1 Effect | Tier N Scaling |
|----|------|---------------|----------------|
| `glyph_potentiate` | Potentiate | +20% damage | +20% per tier, but +15% MP cost per tier |
| `glyph_focus` | Focus | +15% damage, +5% crit | +15% damage per tier, +5% crit per tier |
| `glyph_extend` | Extend | +1 turn duration | +1 turn per tier |

**Effect Glyphs** — Add behaviors.

| ID | Name | Tier 1 Effect | Tier N Scaling |
|----|------|---------------|----------------|
| `glyph_multi` | Multi | Hit **all** possible targets | Boolean (no tiers) |
| `glyph_pierce` | Pierce | Ignore 15% DEF | +10% ignore per tier |
| `glyph_venom` | Venom | Apply poison DoT | +1 stack per 2 tiers |
| `glyph_slumber` | Slumber | 20% Sleep chance | +10% chance per tier |
| `glyph_aegis` | Aegis | **Invert target to allies** | Boolean (no tiers) |
| `glyph_celerity` | Celerity | Grant +20% SPD | +10% SPD per tier |
| `glyph_reflect` | Reflect | 30% reflect chance | +10% chance per tier |
| `glyph_leech` | Leech | Heal 10% of damage | +5% heal per tier |

**Efficiency Glyphs** — Reduce cost.

| ID | Name | Tier 1 Effect | Tier N Scaling |
|----|------|---------------|----------------|
| `glyph_streamline` | Streamline | −15% total MP cost | −10% per tier (diminishing) |

> **The Puzzle:** A Tier 7 Potentiate gives +400% damage but +105% MP cost. A Tier 7 Streamline gives −60% cost. Combining them: net +40% MP cost, but +400% damage. Is it worth a slot? That's the player's call.

## Spell Composition

### The Crafting Flow

1. **Select Hero**: Open their Magic Circle. The UI shows only slots unlocked by their Magic Tier.
2. **Place Glyphs**: Drag Glyphs from the palette into available slots.
3. **Preview**: Live calculation of damage, MP cost, and effects.
4. **Name**: Enter a **custom name** or accept the auto-generated one.
5. **Inscribe**: Save to the hero's Spell Codex.

> **Glyphs are never consumed during composition.**

### The MP Budget Puzzle

Every Glyph adds **power**, but every Glyph adds **cost**. The mage asks: *"Can I afford this?"*

```
Base MP = Core.baseCost

Total MP = Base MP
    × (1 + sum of all Glyph cost modifiers)
    × (1 - Efficiency Glyph reductions)
```

**Example — Early Game Fireball:**
```
Core: Fire (5 MP base)
Power: Potentiate + (×1.15 cost)

Total MP = 5 × 1.15 = 5.75 ≈ 6 MP
Damage = 10 × 1.20 = 12 fire damage
```
> Cheap. Reliable. Mage can cast this 10+ times.

**Example — Late Game Cataclysm:**
```
Core: Dark (12 MP base)
Power: Potentiate ✦✦✦ (×3.0 cost), Focus ✦✦✦ (×3.0 cost)
Effect: Multi ✦✦ (×2.5 cost), Leech ✦✦ (×2.5 cost)
Efficiency: Streamline ✦✦✦ (−60% cost)

Base = 12
Modifiers = 3.0 × 3.0 × 2.5 × 2.5 = 56.25×
Efficiency = 0.40
Total MP = 12 × 56.25 × 0.40 = 270 MP

Damage = 12 × 2.0 × 2.0 = 48 dark damage per target
Targets = all enemies (Multi ✦✦)
Lifesteal = 20% of damage (Leech ✦✦)
```
> A Tier 20+ mage with 600+ MP can cast this. A Tier 10 mage cannot. The puzzle is real.

### The MP Budget Bar

The UI shows an **MP Budget Bar** during composition:
- 🟢 Green: Within hero's max MP
- 🟡 Yellow: 75–90% of max MP
- 🔴 Red: Over budget (cannot inscribe)

This creates natural build gates:
- **Tier 4 mage** (40 MP): Simple 4-slot compositions.
- **Tier 13 archmage** (150 MP): Complex 13-slot spells with multiple effects.
- **Tier 25 legend** (800+ MP): Can afford 20-slot cataclysms.

> **The player never sees exact numbers.** The budget bar is color-coded. The Witch gives poetic hints. The rest is feeling.

### Custom Spell Naming

Before inscribing, the player sees:
- **Auto-generated name**: "Greater Fire of Echoes"
- **Custom name field**: Free text input (max 30 chars)

The custom name is stored with the spell and displayed in combat. Auto-generated names are used as fallback.

> **Player examples:**
> - *"Inferno's Kiss"* — Fire + Potentiate `++` ×3
> - *"Zeus"* — Storm + Focus `+++` + Pierce
> - *"Mom's Hug"* — Light + Aegis → single-target heal
> - *"The Hell"* — Dark + Potentiate `✦✦✦` ×6, Multi, Leech (Tier 20+ mage)

---

## Ally-Targeted Spells (Inversion)

By adding the **Aegis** glyph to any composition, the spell's polarity inverts: instead of harming enemies, it benefits allies. Every core element produces a different beneficial effect when inverted.

### Targeting Matrix

| Aegis | Multi | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| ❌ No | ❌ No | Single enemy |
| ❌ No | ✅ Yes | All enemies |
| ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Single ally |
| ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | All allies |

> **Multi** is now a **boolean** glyph: it costs +250% MP and always hits **all possible targets** (all enemies, or all allies if Aegis is present). No tiered target count.

### Elemental Inversion Effects

| Core Element | Inverted Effect | Type |
|---|---|---|
| 🔥 **Fire** | +ATK buff | `buff_atk` (3 turns) |
| 💧 **Water** | +MP restore | `restore_mp` (instant) |
| 🌪️ **Wind** | +SPD buff | `buff_spd` (3 turns) |
| ⚡ **Storm** | +Crit chance buff | `buff_crit` (3 turns) |
| ✨ **Light** | +HP heal | `heal_hp` (instant) |
| 🌑 **Dark** | +Stamina restore | `restore_stamina` (instant) |
| 🪨 **Earth** | +DEF buff | `buff_def` (3 turns) |

### Effect Amount

Ally effect amount = `Spell Damage × Ally Factor`

Each core has a built-in **allyFactor** that scales the effect:
- **Light** (0.30) — strongest healer
- **Water / Earth** (0.25) — balanced support
- **Wind** (0.22) — moderate
- **Fire** (0.20) — aggressive buff
- **Storm** (0.18) — precision buff
- **Dark** (0.15) — lowest, but highest base damage

> **Example:** A Tier 3 Light spell dealing 40 damage heals for `40 × 0.30 = 12 HP`.

### Design Examples

- *"Mom's Hug"* — Light + Aegis → single-target heal
- *"Group Therapy"* — Light + Aegis + Multi → party-wide heal (+250% MP cost)
- *"Iron Wall"* — Earth + Aegis + Multi → party-wide DEF buff
- *"Second Wind"* — Wind + Aegis → single-target SPD buff

## The Circle Registry (Sealed Names)

Every unique Glyph combination is a **discoverable entity**. The first hero to create it becomes its **inventor**.

**How It Works:**

```
1. Elara composes: [Fire Core] + [++] + [++] + [+] + [AoE]
2. She names it: "☄️ Meteor Strike"
3. The game checks: Has this exact combination been created before?
4. No → "☄️ Meteor Strike" is SEALED. Elara is recorded as inventor.
5. Later, Selene composes the SAME combination.
6. The game shows: "This circle already exists as '☄️ Meteor Strike' (invented by Elara)"
7. Selene can still inscribe it, but the name is locked.
```

**Circle Identity Formula:**
```
circleHash = hash(coreGlyph + ringSlot1 + ringSlot2 + ... + ringSlot6)
```

> **Order matters.** `[Fire] + [++] + [AoE]` is different from `[Fire] + [AoE] + [++]`. Different hash = different name.

**Registry Rules:**
- **Names are permanent.** Cannot rename a sealed circle.
- **Inventor is permanent.** Even if the hero dies, they remain the inventor.
- **Registry is per-save.** Each playthrough discovers its own language.
- **Auto-suggest on creation:** If your composition is CLOSE to an existing one, the game suggests: *"This resembles 'Meteor Strike' but with Ice instead of Fire. Name it?"*

## The Witch's Hut

The **Witch's Hut** is a separate village building where a mystical NPC reads the magical "vibes" of heroes. It is the **only source of progress information** for the hidden Magic Insight and Glyph Mastery systems.

### Building

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Witch's Hut |
| **Cost** | 200g, 80 Wood, 30 Stone |
| **Unlock** | Available from the start |
| **Function** | Visit with a hero to receive a cryptic reading about magical progress |
| **Cooldown** | 1 reading per hero per day |

### How It Works

1. Player enters the Witch's Hut.
2. Selects a hero from the roster.
3. The Witch delivers a **short, poetic dialogue** based on the hero's hidden state.
4. The reading hints at:
   - How close the hero is to their next Magic Tier.
   - Which Glyphs are nearing mastery thresholds.
   - General magical "attunement" (most-used element, casting frequency).

### Dialogue Categories

#### Category A: Far from Next Tier (>50% remaining)

> *"The threads are still weaving, child. The pattern is there, but faint. Cast more. Feel more. The circle will widen when it is ready."*

> *"Your mana flows like a quiet stream. Steady, patient... but no rapids yet. Continue."*

> *"I see embers, not flames. Tend them."*

#### Category B: Approaching Tier (20–50% remaining)

> *"The water stirs. Something is waking beneath the surface. Do you feel it?"*

> *"Your glyphs hum with restless energy. The weave tightens. Not long now."*

> *"The old patterns shift when you cast. The circle senses your growth."*

#### Category C: Near Tier (<20% remaining — imminent!)

> *"I read a VERY POWERFUL MANA inside you! Something is going to happen very soon!"*

> *"The air crackles when you speak your spells. The veil thins. Prepare yourself."*

> *"A new ring calls to you. It is almost within reach. One more push."*

#### Category D: Just Reached New Tier (within 48 hours)

> *"Your effort had a recent reward... let the cycle begin again."*

> *"The mandala has expanded. You stand in a wider circle now. Do you feel the space?"*

> *"A door opened. You walked through without seeing the threshold. Now you see."*

#### Category E: Glyph Mastery Hints

> *"Your Fire Glyph... it no longer feels like a stranger's hand. It is becoming *yours*."* (near 500 casts)

> *"The Potentiate symbol you draw — it has changed. Subtly. The lines remember your hand."* (near 2,000 casts)

> *"There is a depth to your glyphs that I have not seen before. You are not merely drawing. You are *becoming*."* (near 10,000 casts)

### Witch Personality Rules

- The Witch **never gives exact numbers**. No "You are 73% to Tier 4." Only moods and metaphors.
- The Witch **references the hero's most-used element**. A fire mage gets fire metaphors. A water mage gets water metaphors.
- The Witch **remembers previous visits**. If you visit twice in a row with the same hero, she might say: *"Back so soon? The threads have not moved much since yesterday. Patience, child."*
- The Witch **reacts to tier-ups**. If you visit *after* a tier-up without having visited before, she says: *"Something shifted in you since we last spoke. The circle has grown. Did you not feel it?"*

## Glyph Academy

The **Glyph Academy** is a wing of the Arcane Sanctum where heroes teach Glyphs to each other.

### Academy Tiers

| Level | Cost | Teaching Slots | Max Students/Slot | Learning Speed |
|-------|------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Lv 1 | 500g, 100 Wood, 50 Stone | 1 | 1 student | 100% |
| Lv 2 | 1500g, 200 Wood, 100 Stone | 1 | 2 students | 120% |
| Lv 3 | 3000g, 400 Wood, 200 Stone | 2 | 2 students | 140% |
| Lv 4 | 6000g, 800 Wood, 400 Stone | 2 | 3 students | 160% |

### Teaching Duration

```
Base Days = Glyph Tier × 2
Teacher Bonus = −0.3 days per 10 MagicPower
Student Penalty = +0.2 days per extra student
Building Bonus = × speed multiplier
Final Days = max(1, round((Base + Penalty) / (1 + Bonus) × Building))
```

### Design Library (Circle Sharing)

With many heroes, recreating the same spell for 5 mages is tedious. The Academy's **Design Library** solves this.

**How It Works:**
1. Any hero with a spell in their Codex can **"publish"** the design to the Academy Library.
2. Another hero can **"study"** the design to copy it into their own Codex.
3. The target hero must have **all required Glyphs** in their repertoire.
4. If Glyphs are missing, the Academy shows which ones — queue them for Glyph Teaching first.

**Cost:**
- **Gold:** Scales with circle complexity (Core = 10g, +5g per Ring slot)
- **Time:** 2 days (hero locked, studying the design)
- **No teacher required** — the design is in the library. The hero studies alone.

**Design Library Capacity:**

| Academy Level | Max Stored Designs |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Lv 1 | 3 designs |
| Lv 2 | 6 designs |
| Lv 3 | 10 designs |
| Lv 4 | 15 designs |

> **Example workflow:** Elara creates "☄️ Meteor Strike" (Fire Core + 3 Potentiate + AoE). She publishes it. Now Selene, Kira, and 3 other mages can copy it in 2 days each — no teacher needed, just the library.

---

## Spell Codex

Each hero has a personal **Spell Codex** (max 6 slots) where inscribed spells are stored.

- **Unlimited casts:** Codex spells are **not consumed** on use. They are a 6-spell loadout.
- **Replacement:** Inscribing when full prompts the player to replace an existing spell.
- **Tier-locked:** The Codex remembers the spell's composition. A Tier 5 hero cannot cast a Tier 13 spell even if it's in their Codex from before.

---

## Tier Implications (Updated with Mysticism)

| Phase | Tier Range | Experience |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **The Spark** | 1 | Core only. The hero barely knows they have magic. |
| **The Awakening** | 2–3 | First complementary slots open. The hero feels "something" when casting. |
| **The Apprentice** | 4–6 | Ring 1 fills. The hero dreams of geometric patterns. |
| **The Adept** | 7 | Ring 1 complete. The Witch calls them "promising." |
| **The Seeker** | 8–12 | Ring 2 opens and fills. The hero senses mana in the air around them. |
| **The Archmage** | 13 | Ring 2 complete. Other heroes comment on their "glow." |
| **The Legend** | 14–25 | Rings 3 and 4. The hero is recognized as one of the greats. Children whisper stories. |

### Tier Implications

- **Tier 1–6:** Apprentice phase. Simple spells, limited composition.
- **Tier 7:** First milestone — Ring 1 complete. The hero is now a full mage.
- **Tier 8–12:** Expert phase. Two rings allow for complex synergies.
- **Tier 13:** Second milestone — Ring 2 complete. The hero is an archmage.
- **Tier 14+:** Legendary phase. Each new ring is a major achievement.
- **Tier 25:** Four full rings. A god-tier mage capable of world-ending spells.

Not every hero needs to reach Tier 25. A warrior who dabbles in magic might happily stay at Tier 4 (Core + 3 slots) for occasional elemental strikes.

## Design Decisions (Locked)

These questions have been resolved and are now canon:

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **6 slots per ring** (hexagonal) | Visual symmetry, clean progression milestones every 6 tiers, scales to 4 full rings |
| 2 | **Insight is fully hidden** | No bars, no numbers. The Witch gives poetic hints. The MP Budget Bar gives practical feedback. Mystery is a core pillar |
| 3 | **Mastery thresholds: 500 / 2,000 / 10,000 / 50,000 / 200,000 / 1,000,000** | Exponential growth prevents early stagnation. Tier 4 is a month of play. Tier 7 is a year |
| 4 | **Tier 25 is the practical maximum** | 4 full rings = 25 slots, ~800 MP, world-ending spells. Beyond this is "post-game" territory |
| 5 | **Codex sharing via Design Library** | Spells can be published to the Academy Library and copied by other heroes for gold + time |
| 6 | **Spells can be deleted from Codex** | Max 6 slots. Inscribing when full prompts replacement. No cost to delete |
